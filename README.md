#### About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

  A Project in partnership with **APHP** (Hospitals of Paris) .
  The goal is simple : 
    1) To develop an algorithm for automatic segmentation of the myocardial infarction zone 
       from cardiac MRI images in order to quantify the size of the infarction 
       and to locate its territory in the heart.
    2) From a supervised machine learning algorithm integrating the different characteristics of the detected myocardial infarction,
       to predict the risk of mortality of the patient after five years of follow-up.
