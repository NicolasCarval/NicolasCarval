#### About me

- ðŸ”­ I recently worked on ...

  The development of an application made for medical image annotation during my internship at GE HealthCare.
  The goal was to automate the annotation of scanners for specific signs of a pathology (CTEPH).
  
  My missions were : 
    1) To develop an algorithm of Deep Learning for automatic segmentation of the heart ventricles.
    2) To develop an algorithm to approximate the ventricles diameters.
    3) Then to Integrate those algorithms in an application to review the results of algorithms.

  During this internship I developed skills in :
    - Computer Vision (Python, Pytorch).
    - Backend & Frontend programing (C++, TypeScript).
    - SCRUM methodology.
    - Knowledge in the medical field.
  

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a first job...

In the area of Data Science, Computer Vision,  Data analysis.
